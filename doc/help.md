# Want to help us ?

We want to build the best possible dataset! If you feel that the dataset is missing something, please publish an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/meteofrance/meteonet). If you want to improve our notebooks or our documentation, please feel free to make a pull request.

## Editing the documentation

This documentation is built with **mkdocs** and configured in our [git repository](https://github.com/meteofrance/meteonet). 

For more information about **mkdocs**, visit [mkdocs.org](https://www.mkdocs.org/).

If you want to edit the documentation, you can directly modify the markdown files in the ```docs_src``` folder.

### Previewing the docs
