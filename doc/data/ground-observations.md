# Ground Observations

![Masks](../../img/GroundStationsObservations.png)


Hundreds of observation stations are built throughout the French territory, each one fitted with several sensors measuring parameters such as temperature, pressure, wind... Each parameter is measured every 6 minutes and each file contains 1 month of data for each geographical area ('NW' for North-West of France and 'SE' for South-East of France). 

### Files organization

For each zone, the files are stored per year with 2 compression levels (.tar.gz and .tar). 

Example

Here is the path for the NW zone, year 2016 :  
*/data/NW/ground_stations/*  
*NW_ground_stations_2016.tar.gz/*  
*NW2016.tar/NW2016.csv*
